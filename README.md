# No-Sweat-WebDev-Handbook
The "No Sweat Web Dev Handbook" is my take on learning web development from scratch in the most optimal and rewarding way. Master a wide range of web technologies without spending endless hours on each. Stay engaged, have fun, and come out the other side with real skills in everything from frontend to backend, all without losing interest.
